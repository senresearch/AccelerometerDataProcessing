Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is the extension of the ideas of analysis of variance to deal with problems where the dependent variable is multivariate. Since our dependent variable is the functional observation of the physical activity variable (*e.g.*, activity count, steps,...), the methodology we need is a functional analysis of variance, abbreviated FANOVA."
